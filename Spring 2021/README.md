# Spring 2021 Java Projects

These projects were made for the `CSC 22100 Software Design Laboratory` course at The City College of New York (CUNY).

> These projects were created using the Eclipse IDE.

These projects utilized JavaFX for creating visual elements and an UI for later projects. Each successive project built upon the content from the previous project. The general summary of each project is as follows:

- **Project 1:** Creating multiple "shape" classes that build off a single base `MyShape` class and drawing these shapes on a canvas using JavaFX.
- **Project 2:** Utilize a new `MyPoint` class for handing coordinates and writing intersection logic between shapes and whether a point is within a shape.
- **Project 3:** Utilize our shapes to visualize statistical data via a pie chart histogram of the `n` most frequent "events" inside an `Alice in Wonderland.txt` file.
- **Project 4:** Incorporates a database with rendering statistical information. We initialize the database with contents from a file, have interactive elements to modify values within the database, and render those updated changes in histograms.
